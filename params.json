{"name":"Kerbol-plus","tagline":"This is a mod that improves the stock Kerbol System by adding all the officialy planned planets from SQUAD, and more!","body":"### Welcome to Kerbol Plus, a mod designed after the original unimplemented planets from SQUAD. \r\n\r\nThis mod was created because we felt that Kerbal Space Program had not enough planets. And so,  me and my collaborator,  Kill Ashley started developing,  making it accordingly to what SQUAD planned, following a stockalike look. \r\n\r\n### Ok so, how many planets does this add?\r\n\r\nWell, they're quite alot and they are almost double the stock solar system's planets in number.\r\n\r\nThe first ever unimplemented planets, Faz and Harvest. Faz was actualy a moon of Eve that had large crystals but was too buggy to release the it so it was scrapped by SQUAD developers. Harvest was an asteroid that orbited in the L4 of Kerbin. The only thing that remained stock after it was scrapped,  was the height map/terrain map that was later used for Tylo. \r\n\r\nThe Gas Planet Two. It had a few moons, too many to be described, that were not ready to be released and we are still waiting for this legendary  gas giant system.  Fortunately,  this pack also adds it,  in the form of the blue beautiful ringed gas giant,  Sarvin, that has 4 moons and 4 captured asteroids. \r\n\r\nMoons of Sarvin: Potatus, an oblate body made of ice and other unknown materials that has a CRYOVOLCANO! Fonso,  a little moon with thin atnosphere and mountains that extend beyond it.  You can practicaly dive into space from the peqk of a mountain! Daphy,  a moon made of fluff,  is crossed by deep cracks that may hide an ocean. Shayle,  a moon covered in huge craters. \r\n\r\nThis is all we can describe for now. Want to see more? Go check out for yourself by downloading the mod! Thank you!  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
